# ABCD Settings

The product supports single sign-on (SSO) via ABCD. With SSO, users can log in via an Identity Provider and won't need separate login credentials for different services.

## Set up ABCD

1. From the pulldown menu under your user name, select **Manage account**.
2. Select **ABCD settings**.
3. Turn on **Enable ABCD**.
4. Fill the **Single Sign On Url** and **Service provider entity ID** fields.
5. Select **File** or **URL** depending on if you want to provide metadata as an XML file or through an URL.
